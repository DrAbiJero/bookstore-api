A Bookstore CRUD API in Spring Boot

Introduction:
This document explains the design, architecture, and implementation of a CRUD API for a bookstore using the Spring Boot Framework. The API will be used to manage and access the bookstore's inventory, customers, and orders.

Design:
The API will be designed using RESTful principles and will use HTTP methods to perform operations on the data. The API will be based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, with the model representing the data, the view representing the output, and the controller managing the communication between the two.

The API will be implemented using Spring Boot, which provides an easy-to-use framework for building RESTful APIs. The API will use the Spring Data JPA framework to manage the data and the Spring Security framework to secure the API.

Architecture:
The API architecture will consist of a web server, an application server, and a database server. The web server will be responsible for handling the requests from the client and will route the requests to the application server. The application server will handle the processing of the requests and will communicate with the database server to access the data.

The API will use the Spring Boot framework
